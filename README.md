# Walmart Sales Data Pipeline & Analytics

![walmartecomm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5eb8ff3-6cd0-430a-984c-66dc6fc56206)

In this project, I built an end-to-end data pipeline to process and analyze Walmart sales data. The pipeline ingests raw sales datasets, performs cleaning and aggregation, and loads them into a PostgreSQL database for querying. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I conducted exploratory analysis to uncover:

1. Seasonal and monthly sales patterns
2. The impact of holidays on sales
3. Top-performing stores and departments
4. Relationships between sales, CPI, and unemployment

The project demonstrates skills in ETL pipeline design, SQL, data wrangling, and visualization, with real-world retail data.
